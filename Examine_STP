# === STP Lab Plan with Wireshark ===

# STEP 1: Build Physical Topology (Triangle)
# SW1 <--> SW2
# SW2 <--> SW3
# SW3 <--> SW1

# STEP 2: Configure Hostnames
conf t
hostname SW1
exit
# Repeat for SW2, SW3

# STEP 3: Make SW1 Root Bridge
conf t
spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 24576
exit

# STEP 4: Enable RSTP Mode
conf t
spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
exit

# STEP 5: Enable PortFast on Access Ports (host-facing)
conf t
interface range f0/1 - 2
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
exit

# STEP 6: Launch Wireshark (on PC or laptop connected to one of the switches)
# Filter: stp OR rstp
# Alt filter: eth.dst == 01:80:C2:00:00:00

# What to look for:
# - STP BPDUs (Configuration or TCN types)
# - Root ID, Bridge ID, Port ID
# - Changes in topology (TCN flags)
# - RSTP Role/State transitions (Proposal/Agreement bits)

# STEP 7: Trigger Topology Change
# Disconnect one trunk cable (e.g., SW3 <--> SW2)
# Observe BPDU propagation and role change in Wireshark + CLI:
show spanning-tree vlan 1

# STEP 8: Restore Link
# Plug cable back in and watch STP reconverge in Wireshark
# Confirm again in CLI:
show spanning-tree summary

# Additional Steps to Comprehend STP process
# 1. Manipulate the port cost
interface f0/3
spanning-tree vlan 1 cost 19

# 2. Observe BPDU Guard in Action
# On Access Port:
spanning-tree portfast
spanning-tree bpduguard enable

# Plug in another switch and watch the port shutdown
show errdisable recovery  --> check recovery config

# 3. Compare Legacy STP vs RSTP
conf t
spanning-tree mode pvst
exit

# Examine the convergence speed and BPDU structure

# 4. Simulate a topology change notification (TCN)
interface f0/1
shutdown
no shutdown

# Wireshark: observe TCN BPDU
# Verify in CLI
show spanning-tree detail | include occurred

# 5. Loop Prevention Demo
conf t
no spanning-tree vlan 1
exit

# Will cause MAC-flapping and broadcast storms
# Reinstate STP
